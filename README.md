# Iris-Scanning
An iris scanning project involves the development and implementation of a system that uses iris scanning technology to verify a person's identity. This project typically involves designing and building a hardware system, such as a camera, as well as developing the software algorithms that analyze and compare iris patterns. The system may also require integration with a database or access control system for authentication purposes. Overall, an iris scanning project requires a strong understanding of biometric technology, software development, and hardware engineering.
